# House-Price-Prediction
House Price Prediction uses machine learning to estimate the value of a property based on features like location, size, and number of rooms. It analyzes historical housing data to make accurate price predictions. This helps users make informed real estate decisions.
🏠 House Price Prediction
A machine learning project that predicts house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and more. This tool is useful for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals to make data-driven property decisions.

📌 Project Overview
Accurately estimating the price of a house is crucial in the real estate industry. This project utilizes regression algorithms to predict house prices by analyzing historical data and learning from key property features.

Goals of this project:

Build a regression model that predicts house prices with high accuracy.

Understand which features most influence housing prices.

Provide an easy-to-use system for users to input features and receive predictions.

🎯 Features
Predicts house prices based on input features.

Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) included.

Multiple regression models implemented (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).

Performance evaluation with MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² score.

Option to deploy as a web application using Streamlit or Flask.

📊 Dataset
Source: Kaggle Housing Dataset or similar

Features may include:

Lot area

Number of bedrooms/bathrooms

Year built

Garage area

Neighborhood

Sale condition, etc.

Target: Sale Price
